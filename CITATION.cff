abstract: >-
  Deep learning techniques have attained substantial
  progress in various face-related tasks, such as face
  recognition, face inpainting, and facial expression
  recognition. To prevent infection or the spread of the
  virus, wearing masks in public places has been mandated
  following the COVID-19 epidemic, which has led to face
  occlusion and posed significant challenges for face
  recognition systems. Most prominent masked face
  recognition solutions rely on mask segmentation tasks.
  Therefore, segmentation can be used to mitigate the
  negative impacts of wearing a mask and improve recognition
  accuracy. Mask region segmentation suffers from two main
  problems: there is no standard type of masks that people
  wear, they come in different colors and designs, and there
  is no publicly available masked face dataset with
  appropriate ground truth for the mask region. In order to
  address these issues, we propose an encoder-decoder
  framework that utilizes a boundary-aware attention network
  combined with a new hybrid loss to provide a map, patch,
  and pixel-level supervision. We also introduce a dataset
  called MFSD, with 11601 images and 12758 masked faces for
  masked face segmentation. Furthermore, we compare the
  performance of different cutting-edge deep learning
  semantic segmentation models on the presented dataset.
  Experimental results on the MSFD dataset reveal that the
  suggested approach outperforms state-ofthe-art, algorithms
  with 97.623% accuracy, 93.814% IoU, and 96.817% F1-score
  rate.
