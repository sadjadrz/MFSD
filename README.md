Mask region segmentation is a preliminary stage to tackle the occlusion issue corresponding to the face-related tasks. Existing masked face datasets are not procedure binary segmentation maps because Segmenting mask regions manually is a time-consuming operation. As a result, existing unmasking methods by overlaying masks on existing face datasets. However, since these techniques rely on an artificially generated mask, their effects tend to seem unnatural. To address this issue, the masked face segmentation dataset (MFSD) provides the first public training dataset for the face mask segmentation task.
